# machine_learning

Implemented Machine Learning algorithm using Python

1. Linear_Regression:
	* Predict the heart attack based on the age and BP
	* Steps to run:
		* Open the script with Jupyter Notebook for better visualization
		* I have also added the sample dataset "dataset.csv". Please change the path(Line no 8 in above python script) for the dataset as per your system.

2. Logistic Regression:
	* Diabetes Prediction based on different features
	* Steps to run:
		* Open the script with Jupyter Notebook for better visualization.
		* I have also added the sample dataset "diabetes.csv". Please change the path(Line no 5 in above python script) for the dataset as per your system.
